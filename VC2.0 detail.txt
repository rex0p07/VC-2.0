Basic chatbot that uses speech recognition to understand user input and generate responses. The chatbot's responses are provided through text-to-speech functionality. The GUI for the chatbot is created using tkinter.

The code imports the necessary modules such as tkinter, speech_recognition, pyttsx3, and PIL. The chatbot's replies are generated using a separate module called "replies".

The code defines functions such as "talk" to handle text-to-speech functionality, "take_Command" to handle speech recognition, and "get_response" to generate responses based on user input.

The code creates a GUI using tkinter by defining frames for input and output, and buttons for user interaction. The code also uses the PIL module to display an image logo for the chatbot.

Overall, the code provides a basic framework for a speech-enabled chatbot with a graphical user interface.
